## Writeup
This was a pretty simple challenge and probably the easiest during this CTF
competition. Upon clicking the link, we see a simple website with just a home
page. The title of the problem gives us a big hint to open Inspect Element on
Chrome. After looking around, we find our flags in an HTML comment.
